# Getting Started with Ciao Chow App

## Install dependencies

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npx expo start`

When you run npx expo start (or yarn expo start), Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler. This bundler is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of your app using Babel and serves it to the Expo app. For more information, see how Expo Development Server works(https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/#develop).


### Opening the app on your phone/tablet
To open the app:

On your Android device, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Home" tab of the Expo Go app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.
On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple "Camera" app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.
You can open the project on multiple devices simultaneously. Go ahead and try it on both phones at the same time if you have them handy.
